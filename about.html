            <p>Misty Mount staff know their customers love to eat in their room by placing the order by room service. Certainly, it is a luxurious way of relaxing and getting food served in the room. We pamper our guests and make sure they are served a nourishing, comforting hot meals in rooms. The staff do not feel they have to go an extra mile to clean up the remnants of the food. Often, the spillover in the bed necessitates changing the linen.</p>
